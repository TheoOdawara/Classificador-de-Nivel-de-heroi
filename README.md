# Hero Level Classifier

A simple Node.js project that classifies a hero's level based on their experience points (XP).

## How it works
- The program contains a set of heroes, each with a name and XP value.
- When you run the program, it asks for the hero's name.
- It then displays the hero's level according to their XP.

## Levels
- Iron: XP < 1000
- Bronze: 1000 <= XP < 2000
- Silver: 2000 <= XP < 5000
- Gold: 5000 <= XP < 7000
- Platinum: 7000 <= XP < 8000
- Ascendant: 8000 <= XP < 9000
- Imortal: 9000 <= XP <= 10000
- Radiant: XP > 10000

## Usage

1. Install Node.js if you don't have it.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. In the project folder, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

4. Enter the hero name when prompted (e.g., Heroe1, Heroe2, ...).

## Example
```
Type the heroe name: Heroe1
Heroe1 level is Radiant
```
